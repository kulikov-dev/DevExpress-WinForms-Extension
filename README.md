## DevExpress WinForms extension kit
  A small library to solve some troubles, which I met during my work with DevExpress.

### List of components
#### Editors
* CheckedListBoxControlDev. The extension for the standard component supports hotkeys for fast check/uncheck of items. Ctrl+A: check all, Ctrl+D: uncheck all, Ctrl+I: invert checking.
* ColorPickEditDev, RepositoryItemColorPickEdit. The extensions for the standard components allows to save custom user colors during the program, so each ColorPickEdit and RepositoryItemColorPickEdit will have the same, actual user colors.
* DateDoubleTrackbarControlDev. The visual component, which allows users to select range of dates: start, end and date between them. <p align="center"> <img src="DevExpressWinFormsExtension/Resources/Samples/DateDoubleTrackBarSample.jpg" width="230" align="center" title="Screenshot of the DateDoubleTrackbarControl"> </p>
